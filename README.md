# Real-Time-Traffic-Accident-Severity-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a real-time traffic accident severity prediction system using ensemble machine learning techniques.  We make use of traffic, weather, and geolocation APIs to collect data to train and model using ensemble methods to combine multiple models.

# Real-Time-Traffic-Accident-Severity-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a real-time traffic accident severity prediction system using ensemble machine learning techniques.  We make use of traffic, weather, and geolocation APIs to collect data to train and model using ensemble methods to combine multiple models including baseline models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression and advanced models such as Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks. And for User Experience Inmpleted Flask Web application with this machine learning model.
